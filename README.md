Banking System
This is a banking system which allows a banker to manage different bank accounts.
As a banker, you would create new accounts, deposit to an account, withdraw from an account, transfer money from one account to another, delete account, sort the accounts, or do inspection on one or all bank accounts.
The bank maintains a list of accounts.
menu() displays all the available options that a bank clerk can perform.
There is a vector of the bank accounts.
Each element of the vector will have all the account information.
The keyword struct in C++ will make a data structure.
Inside the data structure, all of the account information is defined.
The vector bankAccounts is defined in the main() function.
This means that as long as the program running (the bank is operating), we have the list of bank accounts.
In order to update the information of bank accounts in the vector, you would have to pass the bankAccounts variable by reference to the functions.
